# Hello Everyone
My Name is **Katlynn**, I am 29 years old and I have *Six Children* 
I wanted to get into coding because it always seemed to peek my interest! I am excited to get started.
I am also into photography and it would be great to learn how to code my own website instead of paying multiple fees.
